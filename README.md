## Resources used:-

### IBM WatsonX Assisstant 
=> It is used for front-end interaction. It is used to build converstaional interfaces into applications, devices; it is a core component of chatbot to unserstand user queries
"NLP" -> It takes user input and application response, training of bot with different scenarios of intertstate and intrastate.

### IBM Watson Studio
=> Data scientists, developers and domain experts work together on data - driven projects. It also deals with model training and testing the machine learing algorithim.

### IBM Watson Machine Learning
=> It is used for deployment of chatbot, monitor and manage ML models at scale. It ensures they are available with minimum latency when queried by WatsonX assistant. It also gives the functionality of retraining support to improve one time.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage
=> It deals with Data Management. It is scalable, secure and cost-effective cloud storage solution. It is used for storing data (large datasets). It ensures that data is readibly accessible for both Watson Studio and Watson ML during model training.
